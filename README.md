## Netwerker Pivot

[Check it out!](https://netwerker-pivot.firebaseapp.com/)

This is a pivot of my [original Netwerker project](https://github.com/gness1804/netwerker) with Matt Kaufman and Christine Gamble. The purpose of this app is to facilitate my professional networking as I expand my base of contacts.

Currently, this version contains the following improvements over (or at least additions onto) the original:

* Links to social media sites are now easier to enter and use;
* The flag icons have been replaced with checkboxes in order to make clearer whether or not I have contacted this person.
* The company name now displays in the compressed view for each contact.
